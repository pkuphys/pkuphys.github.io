音乐填词
\-\-\-\-\-\-
with all your laugh and cry
what I all remember
is that you are telling a lie
all my world is only black and white
\-\-\-\-\-\-
dreaming of you night by night
thinking about you my best delight
whatever you want air or light
I make it prepared
\-\-\-\-\-\-
all the birds they want to fly
all the boys want to say I like
can all birds stay on the sky
can all boys make their loves be bride
all against fate do we fight
no surrender but die
\-\-\-\-\-\-
on the way to say goodbye
your cruelty never wants to hide
you say I will suffer
the price is so high
please do not tell me why
I'm just one of passings-by
